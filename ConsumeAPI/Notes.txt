When using API, we copy the URL from the API documentation. We then check how to authenticate the API on the documentaiton as well.
When passing parameters we use the question mark to pass the first parameter. If we need to pass more paramters we then use the 
    ampersand symbol (&).

The ppring package helps to print json format files in a more readible way.
In python, json are automatically converted to a dictionary. We can check it by using type() function. What that means is that
    any methods available for dictionary can be used such as traversing it using .get(<<name>>). For example:
        pprint.pprint(response.json().get('data').get('1').get('quote').get('USD').get('price'))
    This code above gets the price going through the path data > 1 > quote > usd > price.
    The second argument of get which is option allow us to tell the code what to return if nothing is found:
        print(response.json().get('dataaa', {}).get('1', {}).get('quote', {}).get('USD', {}).get('price', {}))
        output = {} instead AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
    The code above will return an empty dictionary instead an error if there is not an object called data inside the json file.
        
A better way to structre this request is by using parameters and headers. In the file example we have this URL:
    'https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v2/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest?CMC_PRO_API_KEY=bb0b0ed9-c02b-4d11-8848-3c71b5ae947d&id=1'
    This url has the base url along with the authentication method and the id.
Parameters normally are used in terms of altering the functionality.
The headers are things that do not change like. We need to say the content type for the headers:

    parameters = {
        'id':1
    }

    headers = {
        'Accepts':'application/json',
        'X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY' = 'bb0b0ed9-c02b-4d11-8848-3c71b5ae947d'
    }

Note that the authetication method cha nges. Check documentation to assure the correct authenticaton parameter is being used 
    with headers X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY           without headers = CMC_PRO_API_KEY
The header above has the authentication method and the key is equal to that.
We then simple set the request.url using the parameters and headers:
    response = requests.get(url, params=parameters, headers=headers). The Url is converted back to base url
