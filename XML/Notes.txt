What is XML?
It standers for Extensible Markup Language. It is similar to HTML. XML is used for data presentation. It is designed to send and receive data.
HTML is used to define which data is being used on the application.

Parsing means to read information from a file and split it into pieces by identifying parts of that particular XML file.

We are using the Element module

    xml.etree.ElementTree module -> Formats XML data in a tree structure which is the most natural representaion of hierarchichal data.

ELEMENT MODULE
For the Element module there are 2 ways to parse information:
    We use the parse function. This function takes a XML in file format to parse it (check file Element)
    We use fromstring function (check file Element)

In order to find elements, we can use tab, attrib, text, etc (check picture with the properties available)

In order to modify an element, we can use the functions set() and SubElement()

To delete attributes, we can use the function pop(). If we want to remove a complete tag we can use the remove() function
